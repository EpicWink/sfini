*sfini* - AWS Step Functions made easy
======================================

Create, run and manage AWS Step Functions easily. Pronounced "SFIN-ee".

This package aims to provide a user-friendly interface into defining and
running Step Functions. Things you can do in ``sfini`` to interact with AWS
Step Functions:

* Implement and register activities
* Define and register state machines
* Start, track and stop executions
* Run workers for activities
* Get information for registered activities and state machines
* De-register state machines and activities

Note: this is not a tool to convert Python code into a Step Functions state
machine. For that, see `pyawssfn <https://github.com/bennorth/pyawssfn>`_.
